# sowatt-websec-framework
My framework and checklist for recon, enumeration, and testing web application security.

This is heavily related to the OWASP testing methodolgy so there will be a lot of overlap.

1. Getting started
- [ ] Read the VDP guidelines then read it again
- [ ] Build a list of assets is in scope and what is not in scope
- [ ] Walk the application, get familiar with functionality.
