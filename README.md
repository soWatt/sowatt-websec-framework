# sowatt-websec-framework
My framework and checklist for recon, enumeration, and testing web application security.

1. Getting started
- [ ] Read the VDP guidelines fully.  
- [ ] Use the TemplateGen.py Script to create a note taking template for the program. Fill in necessary info.

2. Recon
- [ ] Using the asset list from the template, start by manually walking through applications. Take notes on behaviors, endpoints, anything that seems important.
- [ ] Use Sublist3r to discover subdomains and make sure they are in scope. Add these to notes.
- [ ] Search any endpoints for "Index of /" using google. 
- [ ]
